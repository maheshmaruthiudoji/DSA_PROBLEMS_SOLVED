"""
You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a graph, labeled from 0 to n - 1.

You are also given an integer array nums of length n sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer maxDiff.

An undirected edge exists between nodes i and j if the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most maxDiff (i.e., |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= maxDiff).

You are also given a 2D integer array queries. For each queries[i] = [ui, vi], determine whether there exists a path between nodes ui and vi.

Return a boolean array answer, where answer[i] is true if there exists a path between ui and vi in the ith query and false otherwise.
